# Operation Code: Code of Conduct

Operation Code is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We do not merely want a community that is free from hostility; we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive.

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness, colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

## Our standards

It would be impossible to list everything our team can do to create a more welcoming space - but when in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:

* Practice empathy and humility.
* Assume competence first.
* Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the community.
* Listen carefully and actively.
* Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners' context.
* Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
* Treat other people's identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their chosen pronouns.
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

## Hateful Content and Harassement

Operation Code is a place for people to connect and discuss issues related to getting the military community into rewarding technology careers. While we want people to be able to express themselves and their views, Operation Code will always ensure that conversations within our community remain productive, friendly, and empathetic. This means protecting our most vulnerable community members from hateful and harassing content by aggressively moderating such behavior. 
Operation Code has a zero tolerance policy as it relates to posting material that is hateful, disparaging, threatening, discriminatory, objectifying, or harassing in any way. Harassment is defined by any content that is meant to bully, demean, intimidate, abuse, or degrade others and is strictly prohibited. 
Moderators will take swift and decisive action including and up to permanently removing a community member from our slack community and any other Operation Code activities. This removal will be considered permanent and is not subject to review. 

## Unacceptable behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to foster, we've listed the below actions. If you encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy, please use the `/report` command in Slack, or contact moderators@operationcode.org.

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions.
* Mocking someone's real or perceived accent or first language.
* Repeatedly interrupting or talking over other people in meetings and discussions.
* Negative or offensive remarks based on gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, or body size.
* Purposefully being argumentative or aggressive
* Advertising of coding schools or personal projects within #general, or in an off-topic context
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Examples of topics outside mission scope

Keep in mind that this is a community with the goal of first and foremost providing help to members of the military community trying to enter the software development industry. While we encourage socializing, *open discussion on any and all subjects is not the mission of this organization.* As such, avoid potentially controversial subjects, as our community is diverse - you are in mixed company.

We have seen the following topics distract from the mission of Operation Code, the success of our members, and the culture of the community. You may be asked to discontinue these conversations by other community members or a moderator. Moderators are authorized to take action to discontinue these conversations (see 'Our Responsibilities', below)

* Race
* Religion
* Politics
* Socioeconomic status or background
* Neuro(a)typicality
* Physical appearance

## Political Discussions

Operation Code has a tremendous amount of value for many people seeking help to get into a rewarding career in the technology field. It is certainly not the place they come to engage in political discourse. As a result, Operation Code strongly discourages the community from engaging in discussions related to common political issues. This means discussing a certain political party, political candidate, or laws that do not impact the technology industry as a whole. 
Moderators will allow some political discussions to occur when the conversation has a direct impact on technology related careers and other related issues that can have implications for our community. Where multiple viewpoints are present, we will always aim to provide aid to our members, and will not tolerate discussion that detracts from that focus.
These conversations will be allowed as long as they do not violate the guidelines we have outlined throughout the Code of Conduct.

## Our Responsibilities

Moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Our moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, threads, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the team at <moderators@operationcode.org>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately

Volunteers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the staff.

In most situations (with the exception of severe violations of the Code of Conduct, which is explained below), the process of enforcement is as follows:

* Warning - a staff member or moderator will warn someone that their behavior violates our Code of Conduct and ask them to stop the behavior.
* Temporary Ban - if they continue the behavior after a warning, a staff or moderator will temporarily move the person who is violating the Code of Conduct to a private "timeout" channel separate from other channels, where they will be unable to interact with other channels. The length of this timeout is 24 hours by default, but that can be altered (shorter or longer) at the discretion of Operation Code staff and volunteers.
* Permanent Ban - if someone continues violating the Code of Conduct after their Temporary Ban is complete (or in the private "timeout" channel during their Temporary Ban) staff or moderators will permanently ban that person by deactivating their Slack account.

In the cases of severe violations of the Code of Conduct (including but not limited to sexual harassment or publicly posting someone's private information) staff and moderators will immediately proceed to a Temporary Ban and consult with other staff on whether an immediate Permanent Ban is appropriate. If a majority of staff feel an immediate Permanent Ban is warranted, the person's Slack account will immediately be deactivated.

This process applies to all Operation Code members, staff, partners, community, and anyone else who interacts with the Operation Code organization.

*Impersonating an Operation Code Moderator or Staff member is prohibited and will result in an automatic ban.*

### Creating Additional Accounts ("Sockpuppeting")

Attempting to get around a temporary or permanent ban by creating a new account in the Operation Code Slack will result in an immediate permanent ban.
